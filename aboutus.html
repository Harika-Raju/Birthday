        <h2>unshared Feelings</h2>
        <p>Dear MaaaðŸ’–,</p>
        <p>There are some people in life who come and go, but then there are those rare souls who stay, no matter what.
             You, Maa, are one of those rare souls. You are not just my friend; 
             you are my safe space, my problem solver, my guide, and above all, my family in every way that matters.</p>

        <p>No matter what time it is or what Iâ€™m going through, I know I can always turn to you.
             You listen to every sorrow, every happiness, every fear, and every dream of mineâ€”without judgment, without hesitation.
              You donâ€™t just listen, you understand. You donâ€™t just understand, you guide.
             You have shaped me into a better version of myself, and for that, I can never thank you enough.</p>

             <p>Your smile carries a grace that makes the world feel lighter, your words bring peace in the middle of chaos,
                 and your presence is the warmth that keeps everything steady. 
                 And of course, no letter would be complete without mentioning our fights.
                 They are nothing but our own little way of showing love, and honestly, I wouldnâ€™t trade them for anything.
                </p>     
              <p>  
                On your special day, I just want you to know one thing: "You stay where you are, cause you are perfect."

                    Happy Birthday, Maa! Stay the same, always. ðŸ’™
              </p> 

        <p>With love,<br>Your Mind eaterðŸ˜‰</p>
